Grove touch sensor MPR121
=================================  

![MPR121](https://github.com/linux-downey/Grove_touch_sensor_MPR121/blob/master/MPR121_module.png)  


Introduction of sensor
----------------------------  
The MPR121 features an increased internal intelligence plus Freescaleâ€™s second generation capacitance detection engine.

***
Usage:
==========  
Download all the source files and open examples/MPR121_demo/MPR121_demo.ino in arduino IDE. Compile and download and run it on a arduino board.

****
Notice:
=========
>1. This example/MPR121_demo/MPR121_demo.ino is just a simple touch/release demo for general use case.
>2. The pin INT on the board is stay high,When the electrode is touched(key is press),trigger a low level,then return to high.
>3. If the sensitivity is not enough, the sensitivity can be set:set_sensitivity(senvalue),senvalue=0x00~0xFF.
>4. If you want to achieve a more precise control,Set sensor's baseline,threshold.
    Touch condition: Baseline - Electrode filtered data > Touch threshold 
    Release condition: Baseline - Electrode filtered data < Release threshold
